    <h1>Acid Rain in America</h1>
    <h3>What is Acid Rain?</h3>
    <p>
      Acid rain is one of the most direct consequences of large-scale pollution.
      When we see large smokestacks rising out of industrial areas, they are
      typically releasing huge clouds of smoke containing various dangerous
      chemical compounds. Two of the most common compounds released are
      sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These compunds, when
      combined with water and oxygen, will create sulfuric and nitric acids
      that enter our waterways and eventually become precipitation in the form of
      rain, snow, fog or even dust.
    </p>
    <h3>Consequences of Acid Rain</h3>
    <p>
      A low pH level in precipitation has a wide range of effects on plant and
      animal life, ocean acidity and human health. As acid rain makes its way
      into waterways, certain aquatic species will no longer be able to survive
      in the changed environment. In addition to killing off some species,
      some of these toxins will be transferred up the food chain, affecting
      animals in our diets. In areas affected by acid rain, trees and plants
      are often seen decaying rapidly. This is a result of the acid removing
      nutrients from the surrounding soil and surface area of the plant.
    </p>
    <h3>Legislation</h3>
    <p>
      In 1990, the EPA established the Acid Rain Program, a cap-and-trade system
      for sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide transmissions. In a cap-and-trade
      system, pollution sites are only able to emit a certain amount of each
      pollutant (also known as a cap). Sites that install systems to reduce emissions
      are able to trade their excess pollutant allowance to other parties.
      This program both cuts down on total emissions as well as providing financial
      incentives to parties who install emission reducing systems.

    <h3>The Dataset</h3>
    <p>
      For this visualization, I am using the
      <a href="https://ampd.epa.gov/ampd/">EPA's Clean Air Dataset</a>
      which compiles air quality measurements from over 100 monitoring sites in the United States.
      The measurements included date back to the late 1980's, right before the EPA
      introduced the Acid Rain Program. By using the slider in the upper right-hand
      corner, you can see the trend of sulfur dioxide and nitrate pollution in the air over the years.
      Also presented is a graph of hydrogen ion concentration in rainwater taken from
      the Hubbard Brook experimental forest in New Hampshire. This forest was set aside
      for hydrologic research in 1955 and is an important source of water quality readings.
      The hydrogen ion concentration in rainwater is directly affected by the water's pH level.
      Elevated levels of hydrogen ions is an indicator of low pH, which means a higher acidity level.
