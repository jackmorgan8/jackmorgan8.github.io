    <h3>What is Acid Rain?</h3>
    <p>
      Acid rain is one of the most direct consequences of large-scale pollution.
      When we see large smokestacks rising out of industrial areas, they are
      typically releasing huge clouds of smoke containing various dangerous
      chemical compounds. Two of the most common compounds released are
      sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). These compunds, when
